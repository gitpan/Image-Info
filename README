This Perl extention allows you to extract meta information from various
types of image files. The following file formats are supported:

   JPEG (plain JFIF and Exif)
   PNG
   GIF
   PBM/PGM/PPM
   SVG
   XBM/XPM
   BMP/DIB/RLE

Usage is something like this:

   use Image::Info qw(image_info);

   @info = image_info("filename");
   $refto_hash_describing_1st_image = $info[0];
   $refto_hash_describing_2nd_image = $info[1];

Note that while the module is still maintained, no new features
will be added.

Especially the EXIF parsing code is buggy, not tested at all,
and quite incomplete (a lot of manufacturer's MakerNotes and tags are
not parsed at all). If you want a stable, feature-complete, up-to-date
and tested EXIF parsing library, please use Image::ExifTool. 

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the same terms as Perl v5.8.8 itself.
