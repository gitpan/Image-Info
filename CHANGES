Revision history for Image::Info

2008-03-30 v1.28 Tels 128 tests
  * raise minimum required Perl version to v5.6.2
    (it doesn't work on 5.005 anyway, open() with three arguments
     is not supported there and I don't have time to rewrite the code
     for outdated Perl versions. If you need it to run on 5.005, write
     a patch and file a bug report please.)
  * fix bug #15167: Incorrect width and height for JPG files
    (the fix now keeps the highest value for width/height, instead of
     creating an array ref with all the values)

    + let string.t skip tests if Image::Xpm, Image::Xbm or XML::Simple
      are not installed (these would formerly silently fail)
    + Image::Info::XPM and Image::Info::XBM now handle in-memory files better
    + fix also pod_cov.t warnings (was "Image::Info.pm" vs "Image::Info")
  * reduce img/test.gif in size, it did eat up 1/3 of the entire dist size
  * reducing test.jpg with GIMP reveals a bug in EXIF parsing (not yet fixed)
  * MakerNote parsing:
    + add support for Panasonic cameras
    + for the following manufacturers we do not check the camera model, this
      gets all cameras, even yet unreleased ones to work:
      + Canon
      + Panasonic
      + Casio
      + Olympus
      + Fujifilm
