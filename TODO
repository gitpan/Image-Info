* Image::TIFF should not need to slurp
* convert the EXIF parsing code to just use something like
  Image::Exiftool - our code is way to complicated, outdated,
  and it's double work to maintain it
* get rid of the need for XML::Simple for SVG parsing - half
  of the parsing is done via custom regexps, anyway.
* get rid of the comment parsing for SVG, it's whacky and undocumented
